## My process

First investigate how to consume an API...
I divided the id and the advice into two parts and and then merge it with HTML for it to work
I built the html for sections and assign classes to use css
The responsive design it was complicated and it was what took me more time, to resolve it use mediaquerys and assign values according to the size of the sections


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties and media querys
- Flexbox and responsive
- API external

### What I learned

Practice makes a master... This is my first time using an API and it was stressful at first.

### Continued development

I'm making devs web with javascript to practice and develop my programming logic and web design, in addition to practicing the front-end knowledge.
